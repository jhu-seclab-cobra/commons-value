## Section Details

### Development Environment Requirements
- JDK version, Kotlin compiler version, Gradle wrapper version.
- Required tools: Docker, Node.js, or proprietary SDKs if any.
- Platform notes: tested on macOS/Linux/Windows.

### Runtime Environment Requirements
- Supported JDK or Android API level.
- Memory/CPU recommendations for production.
- External services or environment variables needed.

## Writing Guidelines
- Use clear English; avoid marketing language and emoji.
- Keep paragraphs short (≤ 3 lines); prefer bullet points for lists.
- Use present tense and active voice (“This library provides …”).
- Show code in fenced blocks with language identifier `kotlin`.
- Include both Gradle Kotlin DSL and Groovy DSL snippets for dependencies.
- Provide absolute or clear relative paths for file references.
- Use tables only when they improve readability.

## Templates

### Badge Template (optional)
```markdown
[![CI](https://github.com/user/repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/user/repo/actions)
[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.user:project)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.user/project)
```

### Installation Snippet (Gradle Kotlin DSL)
```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.user:project:<version>")
}
```

### Quick Start Example
```kotlin
fun main() {
    val client = ProjectClient()
    client.run()
}
```

### Build & Test Commands
```shell
./gradlew build      # compile and run linter
./gradlew test       # execute unit tests
```
